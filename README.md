This is the first project with The Odin Project.
It took me several attempts to set up my git. I am using windows which made the process a bit difficult, but I am happy i am here now!
This project about creating recipes. In the intial phase I am going to use html only, my understanding is that later on I am going to apply css and js to the same project. 
I am exited. Happy coding everyone!
